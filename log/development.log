В 1844 году получил в академии звание свободного художника[17].\r\n\r\nВ 1845 году Шевченко дважды гостил в Переяславе у своего друга, врача А. О.

Осень 1845 года, проведённую в доме Козачковского, шевченковеды считают периодом подлинного творческого взлёта Шевченко и называют Переяславской осенью Кобзаря: именно здесь он создаёт такие свои произведения, как поэмы «Наймичка»[uk] и «Кавказ», посвящение Шафарику для поэмы «Еретик»[uk], а в ночь на 25 декабря — знаменитое «Завещание» («Заповіт»).

Участники этого кружка, в числе 10 человек, были арестованы, обвинены в создании политической организации и понесли разные наказания. Хотя следствие не смогло доказать причастность Шевченко к деятельности Кирилло-Мефодиевского общества, он был признан виновным «по собственным отдельным действиям»[21].

Картина создана на тему одноимённой поэмы художника. Шевченко стремился, чтобы картина была ясной и понятной, побуждала сочувствие. В 1844 году получил в академии звание свободного художника[17].\r\n\r\nВ 1845 году Шевченко дважды гостил в Переяславе у своего друга, врача А. О. Козачковского (с которым познакомился в 1841 году в Петербурге): в августе и с октября до начала января 1846 года. Осень 1845 года, проведённую в доме Козачковского, шевченковеды считают периодом подлинного творческого взлёта Шевченко и называют Переяславской осенью Кобзаря: именно здесь он создаёт такие свои произведения, как поэмы «Наймичка»[uk] и «Кавказ», посвящение Шафарику для поэмы «Еретик»[uk], а в ночь на 25 декабря — знаменитое «Завещание» («Заповіт»). Работая в качестве штатного художника археологических исследований киевской Археографической комиссии при Киевском университете (которому в 1939 году по указу Президиума Верховного Совета СССР в честь 125-летия со дня рождения поэта было присвоено его имя[18]), Шевченко сделал ряд рисунков архитектурных и исторических памятников Переяслава (сохранились рисунки «Вознесенский монастырь», «Михайловская церковь», «Покровский собор», «Андруше», «Каменный крест св. Бориса»), пейзажей близлежащих сёл. В 2008 году в бывшем доме Козачковского был открыт Музей «Заповита» Т. Г. Шевченко[19][20].\r\n\r\nКо времени пребывания Шевченко в Киеве (1846 г.) относится сближение его с Н. И. Костомаровым. В том же году Шевченко присоединился к сформировавшемуся тогда в Киеве Кирилло-Мефодиевскому обществу, состоявшему из молодых людей, интересовавшихся развитием славянских народностей, в частности украинской. Участники этого кружка, в числе 10 человек, были арестованы, обвинены в создании политической организации и понесли разные наказания. Хотя следствие не смогло доказать причастность Шевченко к деятельности Кирилло-Мефодиевского общества, он был признан виновным «по собственным отдельным действиям»[21].

В 1844 году получил в академии звание свободного художника[17].\r\n\r\nВ 1845 году Шевченко дважды гостил в Переяславе у своего друга, врача А. О.

Далее сюжет переносится к мужчине по имени Грю. Он — настоящий суперзлодей, имеющий собственный дом, реактивный транспорт и армию миньонов. Ему не нравятся любые тревожащие его незнакомцы. Однажды в дверь дома Грю стучатся три девочки-сиротки, разносящие печенье. Их зовут Марго, Эдит и Агнес. Грю не впускает их. Выясняется, что девочки живут в детском доме для девочек, хозяйкой которого является мисс Хэтти, которая не любит никого из детей.\r\n\r\nКогда Грю узнает про похищение пирамиды, в нём просыпается зависть. Он обращается с речью к миньонам, по ходу показывая украденный большой монитор с Таймс-сквер, статую Свободы и Эйфелеву башню (обе копии из Лас-Вегаса), и в конце сообщает, что собирается похитить Луну. Для того чтобы провернуть это дело и стать самым гадким злодеем в мире, ему нужен специальный прибор — уменьшитель. Миньоны его поддерживают, но в плане есть один изъян: для постройки ракеты нужны деньги, которых у Грю нет. Он собирается взять деньги в Банке Зла (англ. Bank of Evil), которым владеет мистер Перкинс. В приёмной Грю встречает молодого злодея по имени Вектор, похитителя пирамиды.

Грю рассказывает о своём плане Перкинсу, но тот отказывается давать деньги, пока не будет похищен уменьшитель.\r\n\r\nГлавному герою удаётся выкрасть уменьшитель у северокорейских военных, но неожиданно появляется Вектор, мстящий за то, что расстроенный Грю, выходя из прихожей, заморозил пареньку голову. Вектор крадёт прибор, заодно уменьшив летательный аппарат Грю(благодаря этому последний прилетает домой на крохотной железке с реактивным двигателем). Грю пытается проникнуть в крепость Вектора, защищённую по последнему слову техники, но все попытки оказываются безуспешными. Чуть позже Грю замечает девочек Эдит, Марго и Агнес, торгующих печеньем. Вектор обожает это лакомство, поэтому впускает сироток в крепость. И тут у Грю появляется идея: создать роботов в виде печенья, те проникнут вместе с настоящим печеньем в дом Вектора и вернут уменьшитель. Под видом испаноязычного стоматолога Грю приходит в приют и удочеряет сироток. Поскольку он холодно относится к девочкам, между ними поначалу возникает неприязнь. Установив для сироток правила, Грю укладывает их спать в кроватях, сделанных из старых бомб.\r\n\r\nНа следующее утро Грю планирует отвести девочек к Вектору, чтобы они продали печенье, в котором спрятаны миниатюрные роботы-шпионы. Но девочки хотят отправиться в школу танцев. Грю не сразу, но всё-таки соглашается отвезти их в балетную школу. Во время репетиции Агнес даёт ему билет на скорое выступление девочек.

ActionController::UnknownFormat (PhotosController#new is missing a template for this request format and variant.

request.formats: ["text/html"]
request.variant: []

NOTE! For XHR/Ajax or API requests, this action would normally respond with 204 No Content: an empty white screen. Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):
